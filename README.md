## Challenge description

<p>
  In this challenge, you must create an application to train what you have learned so far in ReactJS

This will be an application where your main objective is to create a blog from scratch. 
  You will receive a practically blank application that must consume Prismic data and have the interface implemented according to Figma's layout.
  You will have access to several files to implement:

  -   **Formatting dates with `date-fns`;**
  -   **Use of icons with `react-icons`;**
  -   **HTTP requests with `fetch`;**
  -   **Among others.**

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

* **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
